And keep in mind,
the notebook didn't find the Avatar.

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:43,750
You did.

12
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,500
Your notebook may have been useful
in collecting your thoughts,

13
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,375
but your unceasing effort
is what led you to the Avatar.

14
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:51,458
He ran!

15
00:00:52,667 --> 00:00:54,125
The ultimate warrior!

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:58,000
- He's a coward!
- I don't know about that.

17
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,667
But it's clear that this Avatar

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,167
is not what you nor anyone else
would've expected.

And I will find him.

21
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,393
I'm still the heir to the throne.
That's gotta mean something,

22
00:01:14,417 --> 00:01:16,250
even in this dustbin corner of the world.

23
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,417
[Iroh] It does.

24
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:18,417
And in this case,

25
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,167
it is precisely because we are
in a more quiet part of the world

26
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,000
that we have an advantage.

27
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,625
How many places can there be
for an Avatar to hide?

[suspenseful music swells]

[Aang] Kyoshi Island is
only a few hours from here.

30
00:01:34,708 --> 00:01:38,333
According to this,
Avatar Kyoshi was the fiercest of warriors

31
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,542
and a master of what they call
the Avatar State.

32
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:43,542
Maybe something in her shrine
will help me control my power before...

33
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:44,625
You kill someone?

34
00:01:45,458 --> 00:01:47,292
Before it happens again.

35
00:01:52,625 --> 00:01:54,292
- [Sokka] It's time to go home.
- What?

36
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,792
We did our part.
We saved him from the Firebenders.

37
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:58,833
Now it's time to go home. My duty…

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,208
Our duty is to protect the village,
like Dad told us to.

39
00:02:03,292 --> 00:02:04,750
They can protect themselves.

40
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,667
Besides, what good is saving Wolf Cove
if we don't save the world?

41
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,833
Katara, do you hear what you're saying?
Save the world.

42
00:02:10,917 --> 00:02:12,583
- Us.
- Why not?

43
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,542
If the world is gonna have any chance,
it's gonna need Aang.

44
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:17,417
And you're right.

45
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,000
We do have a duty,
and it's to protect the Avatar.

46
00:02:20,083 --> 00:02:22,292
Protect him? You wanna protect him?

00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,000
The guy who nearly
blew us off the top of this mountain.

48
00:02:25,083 --> 00:02:27,125
It's about more than just helping Aang.

49
00:02:27,208 --> 00:02:30,417
Ever since he came into our lives,
things have changed for me.

50
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,417
Before I met him, I couldn't bend
enough water to fill a thimble.

51
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,042
And now look what I can do!
And that's after a single day!

52
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,542
Look around.

53
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:43,542
Look where we are now.

Stop! You're making a mistake.
He's the Avatar!

For a hundred years,

00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:53,208
Kyoshi Island has remained safe
from the ravages of war

145
00:08:53,292 --> 00:08:55,417
by keeping to ourselves.

We expect the outside world
to do the same.

We're not here to cause any trouble.

to learn more about Avatar Kyoshi.

We can't start making exceptions.

We're not just any visitors.
He's the Avatar.

I don't know what life has been like here.

155

To be honest, I don't know
what life has been like anywhere.

156
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,500
I've been away for a while.

But where I'm from,

158

people help each other.

00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:44,458
I know I don't belong here.

00:09:45,667 --> 00:09:48,125
That's something
I've been feeling a lot lately.

161
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,875
But if you can help me,

162
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,042
if I can learn to be the Avatar,

163
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:58,542
maybe I could bring the place I knew,

164
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,833
a world where people were happier, back.

165
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:11,458
What harm is there
in letting him look through some books?

166
00:10:11,542 --> 00:10:12,750
It's not about them.

167
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:14,667
It's about who else may come. I know.

168
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,625
But if he is the Avatar,
how can we turn our back on him?

169
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,667
Such a fierce warrior.

170
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,458
- And yet such a kind heart.
- Mother.

171
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:31,167
Suki, you're too young
to know that there are many in this world

172
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,000
who would take advantage
of that kind heart.

173
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:38,167
I'm not too young.
I just haven't seen the world.

174
00:10:44,542 --> 00:10:46,917
I'm reminded that Kyoshi herself

175
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,208
often benefited from
the kindness of strangers.

176
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,667
And as the Avatar,

177
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:56,375
she believed in helping those
who could not help themselves.

178
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,875
So we will open our village to our guests

179
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,542
for 48 hours.

180
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:07,167
I trust that you will respect
the limits of our generosity.

181
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,446
[Sokka] I get it.
I know why you wanted us off your island.

182
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,125
I'd have done the same thing.

183
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,458
It's a big responsibility,
all these people's lives in your hands.

184
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,208
Personally, I take
that responsibility very seriously.

185
00:11:19,292 --> 00:11:21,833
I, uh… I'm the guardian
of my village, too, so…

186
00:11:22,708 --> 00:11:23,708
You?

187
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:24,958
Yep.

188
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:26,875
[Suki] A guardian?

189
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:31,000
So how are you protecting your people
if you're here?

190
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,458
What? I'm not.

191
00:11:33,042 --> 00:11:34,250
I mean, I am.

192
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:39,333
I may… I may not physically be there,
but still…

193
00:11:39,917 --> 00:11:41,250
That is, I'm…

194
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,167
I have to save the world first.

195
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:47,208
Katara, how does it go again?

196
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:50,208
I'm protecting Aang,
so I'm protecting the village…

197
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:52,958
Hey! Hey! Um…

198
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:57,583
The point is we have a lot in common.
We're both warriors, right?

199
00:11:58,167 --> 00:11:59,167
Before she died,

200
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,042
Avatar Kyoshi trained an elite force
in her image.

201
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,167
One ready to protect
not only our homes but our way of life.

202
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,958
That tradition has been passed down
through the generations,

203
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,208
and it is now my honor
to protect this community

204
00:12:10,292 --> 00:12:12,625
and to uphold the values of the Avatar.

205
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,667
That is why I'm not just a warrior.

206
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,167
I'm a Kyoshi Warrior.

207

[curious music plays]

208
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:29,909
[Zuko] Where's your commander?

209
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,750
I need recent surveillance reports
right now.

210
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:34,292
- Excuse me?
- And maps.

211
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,750
Nautical maps.
The more detailed, the better.

212
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:39,583
[man] And you are?

213
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,333
Prince Zuko.

214
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:46,250
What an honor to welcome
actual royalty to our humble base.

215
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:49,250
- What can I do for the crown prince?
- As I was saying, I need...

216
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,750
Please excuse my nephew.

217
00:12:52,292 --> 00:12:53,750
We've been at sea a long time,

218
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:57,000
and our manners
have grown as rusty as our anchors.

219
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,167
General Iroh, no need to apologize,

220
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,250
and please forgive our lapses as well.

221
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,792
We don't get
many VIP visitors around here.

222
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:09,167
Much less the famed "Dragon of the West."

223
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,042
As my nephew was saying,

224
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:15,458
we are in search of maps
and surveillance reports.

225
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,917
We're hoping to track schools
of jumping shark squids.

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,625
- Sh… shark squids?
- [Iroh] Mmm.

227
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,625
They're migrating this time of year.

228
00:13:23,708 --> 00:13:27,292
Oh, they're delicious,

Hmm. [chuckles]

Huh.

I see.

Anything I can do to help.

If you wouldn't mind
giving me until the morning,

234

we can track down what you need.

Well, these are just the easy forms.

Well, it's more
than you could do before, right?

248
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,750
You caught on quickly.
You're a real Waterbender, Katara.

249
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,667
You know, you should be practicing too.

250
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,333
The Avatar needs to master
all four elements.

Maybe later.

252

I can't imagine what it's like
knowing you'll have to save the world,

253
00:15:32,542 --> 00:15:36,500
but avoiding practice doesn't mean
you'll avoid the responsibility.

00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,458
I know.

It's just Gyatso used to be the one
who trained me.

I've never really trained
with anyone else.

It's okay.

258
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,125
We'll do this together.

We're not going anywhere.

260

Or you could just let me use you
for target practice.

Nothing that can help me train.

329
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:35,250
So how am I supposed to figure out
how to save the world?

330
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:38,125
How do I stop the Fire Nation

until she was hired as a house girl
for the richest family on the island.

She was quiet and kind.
No one had a clue she'd become the Avatar.

Yeah, so how did she go from this…

Just like how you and Sokka were
when I went into the Avatar State.

What if nothing in here can help me?

What if I never learn
how to control my power?

all the previous Avatars
are incarnations of your past lives.

You are literally not alone.
The other Avatars are inside you.

355
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,875
You want someone to teach you,
you just need to figure out

He heard something

Not being a bender means

[Kyoshi] There are many dimensions
to being the Avatar.

463
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:57,542
You need to be a guardian,
a general, a mediator, a guide.

464
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,542
You must fill several roles,

Yes. And to help you gain control
over the ultimate power.

Knowledge of your opponent,
knowing where he might go,

481
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,875
is more important than speed.

482
00:29:51,458 --> 00:29:55,458
And so where there is one Avatar,
there may be another.

[suspenseful music playing]

484

Such a lovely island.

And we welcome you to it, Commander.

Though we wish
we'd had some advanced notice.

487
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:22,292
We are quite unprepared for guests.

488
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,083
Funny. That's not what I'd heard.

489
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:29,333
I understand you had an unexpected visitor
just the other day.

490
00:30:29,417 --> 00:30:30,958
You must be mistaken.

491
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:33,125
We like keeping to ourselves.

492
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:34,875
I've heard.

493
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:40,333
Yes, I've heard Kyoshi Island
has had an admirable history of staying,

494
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:44,417
shall we say, insignificant,

495
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,875
which is why there's been
no need for the Fire Nation

to get involved in your affairs.

497
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:56,917
I'd hate to see all that change
because of an outsider.

498
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,083
Commander, the way I see it,

499
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:04,333
you and your men
are the only outsiders here.

500
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,250
An unfortunate perspective.

501
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,792
You won't mind
if we take a look ourselves?

[Kyoshi] You wanna know
what is the Avatar? I can't tell you that.

507
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:56,875
Every Avatar is different.

508

We are shaped by the different demands
of our times.

So I have to figure this out myself?

That is part of the journey.

But what if I hurt someone along the way?

And how many have already been hurt
because you haven't been here?

513
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:20,708
Run away from your responsibilities again,
and even more will be hurt!

514
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:24,000
Being the Avatar
means putting your duties above all else.

and I will show you
what will happen if you fail.

just as the Air Nomads were.

You asked me
what it means to be the Avatar.

00:41:04,792 --> 00:41:09,167
I fully understand
the sensitive nature of this information.

645
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:13,583
And if you'll permit me, working together,

646
00:41:13,667 --> 00:41:19,000
we'd be able to devote
twice as many resources to the hunt.

647
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:23,375
Obviously, with Your Highness
taking the lead in all matters...

648
00:41:23,458 --> 00:41:26,042
- Wait, we don't...
- An excellent suggestion, Commander.

649
00:41:26,125 --> 00:41:30,833
We would be honored
to have your partnership and your loyalty.

650
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:33,750
Believe me, there's nothing more important

651
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:36,875
than knowing where to place my loyalties.

[Zhao] <i>But I have news for you</i>

657
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:58,792
<i>I know this information
may arrive as a shock,</i>

658
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:03,583
<i>and you might be tempted to dismiss it

<i>but rest assured,</i>

660
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,417
<i>I have witnessed these events
with my very eyes.</i>

661
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,917
<i>That is why
I can report an astounding development.</i>

662
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,292
<i>One that could
change the future of the Fire Nation.</i>

The Avatar has returned.
